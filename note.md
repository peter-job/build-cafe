### Dockerise or script?

I don't like having to set up services and stuff and affecting services on host
Would be nicer to have everything containerised IMO
Running the ddns script via docker container - Does this make sense?
Seems like too much for running a single service
Say we use docker-compose
I think it kind of makes sense actually
If I wanted to add a db to this, I would be able to add it to compose
OK
